# rememboy

8 bit photographs at regular intervals to boost episodic memory recall. 

Basically going to be a [Microsoft SenseCam clone](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sensecam/) but with a [Game Boy Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera) for nerd points.

An excuse to play with using the NRF52832 in a daily-use wearable device. Will be looking to optimize:

* Ease of use
* Battery life
* Size & weight
